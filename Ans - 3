In HTML, there is a distinction between HTML tags and elements, although the terms are often used interchangeably. Here's how they differ:

HTML Tags:

HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML document.
They are used to define the structure and content of different elements in the document.
HTML tags are written using angle brackets (<>) and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
The opening tag begins with the < character, followed by the tag name, and ends with >.
The closing tag begins with </, followed by the tag name, and ends with >.
