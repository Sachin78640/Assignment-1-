The <figure> tag and the <img> tag serve different purposes and are used in different contexts within an HTML document.

<img> Tag:

The <img> tag is a self-closing tag used to embed images into an HTML document.

It is used to insert a standalone image, with no additional related content or caption.

The <img> tag requires the src attribute to specify the source URL of the image.

Additional attributes like alt, width, and height can be used to provide alternative text, specify dimensions, or add other attributes related to the image.

<figure> Tag:

The <figure> tag is used to encapsulate self-contained content, typically an image along with its caption or description.

It provides a semantic container for related content, allowing the image and its associated text or caption to be treated as a single unit.

The <figure> tag is often used in conjunction with the <figcaption> tag to provide a caption for the image or description.

In summary, the <img> tag is used to embed standalone images into an HTML document, while the <figure> tag is used to group an image with its associated content, such as a caption or description. The <figure> tag provides a semantic structure that denotes the relationship between the image and its accompanying text, enhancing accessibility and improving the understanding of the content's context.
